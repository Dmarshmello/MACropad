# Congratulations on Building Your First MACropad!

Now that youâ€™ve completed your MACropad, you have two exciting pathways for configuring it:

## QMK Configurator

Using the QMK Configurator offers these advantages:

- **Ease of Use**: Quickly map your keys with an intuitive interface and extensive preset libraries.
- **No Coding Required**: No need for coding your MACropad, instead just upload your layout.
- **Time Efficient**: Set up your MACropad efficiently with built-in functions and configurations.


## DIY Coding

Opting for DIY coding provides you with the following benefits:

- **Extensive Customization**: Create complex macros, including app launches and interface interactions.
- **Complete Control**: Modify and expand your setup as needed with more software and libraries.
- **Learning Experience**: Gain deeper insights into the programming and customization of your MACropad. This hands-on experience can also be showcased in your portfolio to highlight your skills in hardware and C++ software integration.


Both methods have their strengths. Consider your needs and preferences to choose the best approach for your MACropad.
